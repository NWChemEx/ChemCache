Reference Data Directory
========================

This directory contains externally known data that is needed for NWChemEx to
run.  The files contained in the subdirectories are ASCII lists/tables of the
data.  Python scripts exist to turn this data into source files and should be
used to update files should the need arise.

The reference data within this directory is further subdivided into the 
following types:

- Physical Data
  - Atomic masses, names, abundances, isotopes, physical constants, *etc.*
  - Source files generated by script `generate_atomicinfo.py`
- Basis Sets
  - Standard Gaussian basis sets like 6-31g* and aug-cc-pVDZ
- Atomic guesses
  - Precomputed atomic SCF results for initial guesses, from select basis sets
- Molecules
  - Pre-defined molecules for quickly and easily building tests or running 
  pre-defined sets
