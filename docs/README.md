Building the documentation
==========================

Assuming CMake was able to build the C++ API documentation, the final
documentation is built by running `make html` in this directory. The Sphinx
front-end of the documentation requires the following Python packages (all can
be installed with pip):

- sphinx_rtd_theme (The Read-The-Docs theme for sphinx)
- sphinx (The thing that makes the documenation)
